# AdventOfCode2021
This repository contains solutions for puzzles for Advent Of Code 2021 event

___
### Why I've created this repo?
Simple - to force upon myself regularity in solving puzzles from the events and to keep the code somewhat readable.


_If you have some audience your will put more work in your code_.

#### First day - Ascending into the darkness
##### _01.12.2021_
I love those stories! The characters, ridiculous situations and problem to solve. Didn't expect the ocean themed puzzles 

Made it in time regardless going into overthinking of the structure of the files. To notice for tomorrow - I need to think
about running scripts without need to run _node pathToFile.js_. Also needs some parametrization for running examples while
debugging and running main puzzle.
